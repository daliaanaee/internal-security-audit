# internal-security-audit

This is a portfolio activity I completed for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.  
It includes a controls and compliance checklist for a fictional company called Botium Toys.

The checklist goes over which security controls the company currently has and which ones they still need to work on. I also added a short recommendation section at the end with suggestions on how to further improve their security.

The file in this repo is the PDF version of the completed checklist.
